# [Eventlite](http://eventlite-mako.herokuapp.com)

## Introduction
Eventlite is a clone of the event management and self ticketing website [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/). Eventlite recreates the feel and aesthetic of Eventbrite, I do not own any Eventbrite content used in the production of this website. 

## Technologies
### Frontend
_* React.js, Redux.js, Javascript, HTML5, SCSS_
### Backend
_* Ruby on Rails, JBuilder, Postgresql
### Hosting
_* Heroku, ~~AWS~~

## Landing Page
Eventlites landing page provides the user with the most relevant events. I began this project in Februray, Black History Month and during the Coronavirus pandemic, so Eventlite suggests online events and suggests it's users to search for events related to the black diaspora(workshops, museums, etc.)
