From the Booker-winning The Remains of the Day, to the dystopian parable of Never Let Me Go, his novels explore profound ideas about the human experience.\n\nKlara and the Sun is the story of an 'Artificial Friend' who awaits the day a human customer will select her for companionship. When it becomes evident that her circumstances may change forever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.\n\nA luminous narrative about humanity, hope and the human heart, Klara and the Sun is the first novel from Ishiguro since his Nobel award. Join him for a livestreamed discussion with writer and critic Alex Clark, and the rare opportunity to put your questions to one of our most loved writers.\n\nWe have a limited number of tickets including a signed copy of the novel, priced £26. All other books bought with tickets will be bookplate signed editions - please check the description of your ticket. Books will be shipped by Waterstones on 3 March.\n\nKazuo Ishiguro is published by Faber. Visit their website to find out more about Faber Members.\n\nRunning time: 75 minutes\n\nThis event will not be recorded and will not be available to watch after the time at which it is livestreamed.\n\nIf you live in the UK, you may purchase a ticket with a signed copy of Klara and the Sun at checkout .\n\nThis event will be hosted on a third-party live streaming platform BlueJeans, please refer to their privacy policy before purchasing a ticket to the event. After registering, please refer to your confirmation email for access to the event.\n\nIf you require closed captions to be available on this event notify us on your booking form when making your purchase.\n\n*Books will be dispatched on 3 March 2021.

From the Booker-winning The Remains of the Day, to the dystopian parable of Never Let Me Go, his novels explore profound ideas about the human experience.nnKlara and the Sun is the story of an 'Artificial Friend' who awaits the day a human customer will select her for companionship. When it becomes evident that her circumstances may change forever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.nnA luminous narrative about humanity, hope and the human heart, Klara and the Sun is the first novel from Ishiguro since his Nobel award. Join him for a livestreamed discussion with writer and critic Alex Clark, and the rare opportunity to put your questions to one of our most loved writers.nnWe have a limited number of tickets including a signed copy of the novel, priced £26.

From the Booker-winning The Remains of the Day, to the dystopian parable of Never Let Me Go, his novels explore profound ideas about the human experience.\n\nKlara and the Sun is the story of an 'Artificial Friend' who awaits the day a human customer will select her for companionship. When it becomes evident that her circumstances may change forever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.\n\nA luminous narrative about humanity, hope and the human heart, Klara and the Sun is the first novel from Ishiguro since his Nobel award. Join him for a livestreamed discussion with writer and critic Alex Clark, and the rare opportunity to put your questions to one of our most loved writers.\n\nWe have a limited number of tickets including a signed copy of the novel, priced £26. All other books bought with tickets will be bookplate signed editions - please check the description of your ticket. Books will be shipped by Waterstones on 3 March.\n\nKazuo Ishiguro is published by Faber. Visit their website to find out more about Faber Members.\n\nRunning time: 75 minutes\n\nThis event will not be recorded and will not be available to watch after the time at which it is livestreamed.\n\nIf you live in the UK, you may purchase a ticket with a signed copy of Klara and the Sun at checkout .\n\nThis event will be hosted on a third-party live streaming platform BlueJeans, please refer to their privacy policy before purchasing a ticket to the event. After registering, please refer to your confirmation email for access to the event.\n\nIf you require closed captions to be available on this event notify us on your booking form when making your purchase.\n\n*Books will be dispatched on 3 March 2021.
